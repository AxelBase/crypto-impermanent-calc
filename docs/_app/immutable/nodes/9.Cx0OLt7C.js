Pure impermanent loss calculations intentionally isolate price change effects and exclude several critical real-world factors.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The primary limitation is that these tools do not account for trading fees earned from pool activity. In actual decentralized exchanges, providers receive a portion of every trade's fee, which often represents the main incentive for supplying liquidity and can significantly offset or exceed impermanent loss.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">What Pure Calculations Exclude</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">These calculators focus solely on the mathematical consequence of price divergence in a constant product pool. They deliberately omit trading volume, fee tier, pool depth, and gas costs to provide a clean measure of divergence impact alone.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Additional excluded elements include compounding effects from fee reinvestment, impermanent loss protection mechanisms, farming rewards, and opportunity costs of capital. Each of these can dramatically alter net returns in practice.</p> <h3 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Important Context</h3> <ul class="svelte-q8x3kg"><li class="svelte-q8x3kg">High-volume pools often generate substantial fees that compensate for moderate impermanent loss</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Low-activity pools may underperform holding even with small divergence</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Fee tiers vary between platforms and pairs, affecting compensation potential</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Real returns combine both impermanent loss and fee income</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Proper Interpretation</h3> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Use pure impermanent loss calculations as a risk measure rather than a complete return forecast. They effectively answer the question of how much value is lost to divergence alone, providing a baseline for evaluating whether expected fees justify the exposure.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Why exclude fees from the calculation?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">To isolate the pure effect of price changes, making the result comparable across all pools regardless of trading activity.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Does negative IL mean I lose money?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Not necessarily.
